# nvim-metals

`nvim-metals` is a Lua plugin built to provide a better experience while using
Metals, the Scala Language Server, with Neovim's built-in [LSP
support](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html). This plugin provides the
necessary commands you'll need to develop with nvim and Metals. This extension
also implements the custom Metals LSP extensions that will give you a much
richer experience than just using Metals with the default
[nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) setup, as well as
automatically setting all of the correct `init_options`, and offering some
integrations with other projects such as
[nvim-dap](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap) and
[Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim).

## Prerequisites

- Before you get started you need to ensure that you are using nvim v.0.6.0 or
    newer.
- Ensure [Coursier](https://get-coursier.io/docs/cli-installation) is installed
    on your machine. `nvim-metals` uses Coursier to download and update Metals.
    _NOTE_: On Windows, you should run `coursier` or `cs.exe` once from the command
    line as this is how it will install itself. Once this is done you should 
    add `C:\Users\YOURNAME\AppData\Coursier\data\bin` to your path. To verify
    that it is properly installed you can run `cs --help` from a new shell.
- Remove `F` from `shortmess`. `set shortmess-=F`
    (for lua `vim.opt_global.shortmess:remove("F")`)
    _NOTE_: Without doing this, autocommands that deal with filetypes prohibit
    messages from being shown, so some of the messages we show to help users get
    started may not be shown. _If_ you're confident you don't need help setting
    up, then just remove this, and `nvim-metals` will work fine, but any log
    messages won't actually be shown to you if something goes wrong with
    `nvim-metals`.
- Ensure that you have mappings created for functionality that you desire. By
    default methods for things like goto definition, find references, etc are
    there, but not automatically mapped. You can find a minimal example
    configuration
    [here](https://github.com/scalameta/nvim-metals/discussions/39).
- This plugin relies on [plenary.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim)
    which you're more than likely already relying on for other plugins. However,
    make sure to also have this installed.
- Subscribe to [this
    discussion](https://github.com/scalameta/nvim-metals/discussions/253) which
    will notify you of any breaking changes.

## Installation

_NOTE_: This plugin works without needing to install
[neovim/nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig). If you have
it installed for other languages, that's not a problem, but make sure you do not
have Metals configured through `nvim-lspconfig` while using this plugin. If you
have metals setup registered with `nvim-lspconfig`, you'll want to remove
it.

`nvim-metals` is just a plugin installed like any other Neovim plugin. For
example if using [`packer`](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim):

```lua
use({'scalameta/nvim-metals', requires = { "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim" }})

```
